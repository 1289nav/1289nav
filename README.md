Hi, I'm Abhinav — a curious generalist passionate about building at the intersection of AI, product thinking, and ethical technology. My work spans:

🧪 0 → 1 Product Strategy – From fuzzy ideas to user-tested MVPs, I enjoy solving ambiguous, high-leverage problems

🧠 AI Safety & Alignment – Exploring how we can build robust, interpretable, and aligned AI systems.

⚙️ AI-based Coding & Dev Tools – Prototyping tools that help humans reason better and code faster.

📊 Data-Driven Product Building – Leveraging data and first-principles thinking to design products users love.

I believe in shipping fast, learning in public, and keeping humans at the center of every system we build. You'll find a mix of research prototypes, teardown projects, and real-world tools in this repo collection.

Let's build responsibly, and let's build well.
